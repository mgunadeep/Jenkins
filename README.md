 # To add a single-line comment in a Jenkinsfile, we can use the two forward slash characters (//). Any text that is added after the characters until the end of the line is treated as comments.

 # To comment, multiple number of lines in a Jenkinsfile, we start with a forward slash and an asterisk character (/*), and to close it...we start with an asterisk followed with a forward slash (*/).
